They tend to open up and share their ability.  It’s tricky, cause if you get one bad apple.  Those still attempting to come out, might stay back out of fear.  Delicate balance</p>

It's very easy to lose yourself to that act; we see it every day, and lose track of that growth because it's divided between the self and the ego. That's why I was careful to not say "don't ever." Sharing is good. When self-aware.</h3>

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">Cause Sunbreaker feels like it's in a good spot. Granted there's some bad things about it like that new melee slam, for what it does and only giving one fragment, it has to be the worse aspect since pre-buff diamond lance. The super damage feels lackluster considering it was marketed as the "big damage dealer" class. But the nerfs that Roaring Flames and Sunspots seems justified as you can easily proc the new radiant buff. And with Sunspots gaining restoration effect, it adds survivability to the class now. Hammer Throw can give you that radiant buff up constantly with Ember of Torches. Hallowfire Heart is a good exotic for constant ability regen comboing with Sunspots. And I love how Loreley Splendor went from top tier pvp exotic to top tier pve exotic by making you feel practically unkillable. 


You can make a build with Melee Wellmaker, Font of Might, Elemental Charge, and High Energy Fire, with the fifth mod being flexible. All you have to do is get a kill with your mini hammer and you'll be swimming in buffs. 


I may get down voted to oblivion but just as with Void 3.0, I been really enjoying Solar 3.0 on Titan.</p>

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <h3 class="reddit-card__details__text">It’s going to take some time to identify builds, find synergies, and get into the swing of 3.0. We learned this with Void, and we’ll likely see some similar chatter when Arc comes around.

That said,

There is entirely valid feedback in many of the posts and conversations. Difficulty in finding a given build is great feedback. Not understanding new “costs” for a given build that used to exist in the 2.0 paradigm is great feedback. New verbs being confusing or hard to understand is great feedback.

I do wish that some would take a bit more time to dig, or avoid saying things fueled entirely by frustration after a rough play session, I’ll never expect every piece of feedback to be perfectly worded or devoid of emotion. The only feedback I’m not super into usually deals with personal jabs, overly harsh language, or straight up saying “lol someone should be fired” - none of that helps us to make stuff better. Totally fine with critical and harsh feedback, but there’s a line to cross when it gets personal.

Really do appreciate the constructive posts and conversations found throughout many threads. Keep ‘em coming. We’ll continue collecting/passing along the feedback through the launch period and beyond. Team is looking at opportunities to address some pieces, planning comms to help others. Once we have more info, we’ll let you all know.</h3>

Its night and day to how I felt as a player during destiny 1 and into early destiny 2. Keep up the quality and frequency in your engagement with the community.

As a final reddit reply before leaving for three weeks, I can say this: We've been empowered by the team at large to spread more information more frequently. It's been awesome to see this community grow, and see Bungie adapt to further support of a live game. We've done good work on the community team to push the needle, but none of it would be possible without the support of everyone at the studio. Of course there are plans we can't share or conversations that we can't always have, but damn does it feel good to dive in to the nitty-gritty from time to time.

We've made TWAB/Patch Note mistakes in the past (Auto Rifles buffed by .04%) that led to a desire to avoid specific numbers and such. Multiple open conversations over the years were met with hostility and harassment from portions of the playerbase that obviously didn't represent what the Destiny community actually is. While it's taken a few years, we proved out that TWABs like these are valuable. We're looking at future opportunities to spread information and continue to humanize the team. We're looking for more community leaders to help us communicate clearly with larger audiences, while guiding the conversation in constructive and respectful ways when it comes to feedback. We're looking for more opportunities to acknowledge where we've made mistakes or even failed, but also opportunities to embrace all of the crazy cool shit in Destiny as it continues to evolve year over year.

Looking back over the last 7 years of working here, I can say without a "PR lens" that I'm still fucking stoked to work here, even after all the hard days. The future is so damn bright, and I'm thankful to be able to do things like this.

Much love, see you all again soon.</h3>

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">They are gonna need something to coax veterans of those raids to play them again. Imo, the obvious answer is making all those weapons craftable, its already extending the longevity of VotD. Without craftable weapons I would certainly not be running that whole raid on all three characters each week without crafting. I'd probably just run it once for the challenge and 2 boss cps for a shot at the exotic, but with craftable weapons I am incentivized to run the whole thing. I really hope the old raids get craftable weapons otherwise I don't see myself or a large majority of raiders running them very often.

Edit: Obviously, new cosmetics and stuff would be great, but to me this is the bare minimum Bungie can do to convince everyone to run these raids routinely again.

Edit: LMFAOO, yeah thats not gonna do it for me.</p>

            <h3 class="reddit-card__details__text">I would say that this initial offering is targeting many in the community that didn't have the opportunity to engage with a given raid when it was the new hotness, so to speak. This has potential to focus raid LFG's to specific activities on a given week, give players some unlocked checkpoints for targeted weapon farming, and a few other fun things. Many who never had a chance to finish the Divinity quest might have an easier time finding a group. Some who never got a good roll on a given dungeon weapon might finally get that perfect roll.

&#x200B;

If you are at max pinnacle power, have all the best rolls, and have completed every raid triumph in existence? Completely understandable that it wouldn't tap deep into your desires. There's always room for more development and changes in the future to reignite some excitement for more groups in the community, and we're looking forward to feedback on this initial offering.</h3>

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <h3 class="reddit-card__details__text">Hey all,  


Thanks for the feedback. Here are some general notes I'll be passing up to the team:

* Removal of weapons outright (not providing alternate acquisition sources) can be frustrating after multiple seasons of hunting a specific weapon and not getting a drop, or a "good" roll. (Good is in quotes as this can be subjective based on the player!)
* Players would like to see many of these weapons shifted to umbrals, or in the case of Rituals, shifted to a focusing system akin to Trials

&#x200B;

**Wanted to give some more details on the "why" for this as well:**  
The team has been full steam ahead on the next year of Destiny content. Witch Queen, Season 16, and more. While they'd love to maintain some acquisition sources for many of the weapons being rotated out, we don't have infinite resources to dedicate to this. I've posted on here before about prioritization in development and how some things need focus over others, and this is another one of those examples. Allocate team members to building out a bunch of umbrals, creating new icons, putting them on various vendors, testing them, spending a bunch of time on them if bugs arise... or spend that time fleshing out new systems coming online with Witch Queen, new umbrals, new weapons, etc?

&#x200B;

While the team did have bandwidth to add many of these weapons to the Xûr rotation, this is by no means seen as a perfect solution by anyone at the studio. We do have more vendors being updated over the next few seasons to align with the focusing system on Saint for Trials loot, but this takes time. We can't upgrade every vendor immediately, so we're plotting out updates season over season. This doesn't help the immediate feedback of "I never got a good Multimach!", but hopefully in future seasons when Iron Banner is updated, we can avoid this sort of feedback coming up again. The team is opting to remove the bloat now, rather than have another season of "I'm still hunting that multimach, but also trying to get some of the new guns, and even trying to get some guns from a season or two ago because some perks were tuned to make that gun a bit more desirable..."  


When looking at "bloat" in all sources (Nightfall, Legendary Engrams, IB, Trials) , removing a few weapons frees up *a lot* of space for some new things to come online and helps us tighten up the calendar of rotation so players (new and old) don't have to wait *too long* before the weapons come back around.

&#x200B;

**Re: "Why are you bringing back old weapons?"**  
With the amount of new perks that have come online over the last year, and some new ones that will come in future seasons, the team is excited to rotate a handful of older weapons back in with updated perk pools. Summoner has been a pretty frequent request, and bringing it back opens up opportunity for a few new spicy rolls (while maintaining old desirable perk combos). The two returning Nightfall weapons never had random rolls in the past, so there's a bit of opportunity to make them feel completely new and badass! Hitting that perfect mix of "old gun, new tricks" and "new gun, old and new tricks" is a challenge the team takes on every season. We haven't even covered a bunch of the new loot coming online in just a few weeks. Some will be covered in a TWAB or two, while others will be left for you to find in the field.  


**Ah, and to touch on a last question - "Why wasn't this in the TWAB?"**  
While we've been putting a bit of effort into covering what bounties were being removed, we hadn't dug in to the ritual weapon offering with the team. We'll keep this in mind for future seasons and expansions to hopefully get the information out a bit earlier.  


Cheers to all who've been giving the feedback. We'll make sure it gets to the team.</h3>

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">The problem is a system that forces people into the DOE.

Even now, after you set your light levels close to 1100 with low light level items(ex.FOTL mask) and enter the DOE, you can meet 5 New Lights who have been suffering from champions and boss enemy for an hour.

In Small D2 community in my country, Entering the DOE after downgrade their own light levels to help these New peoples has become a trend.

I also lowered my own light levels below 1100 and challenged DOE so  I was able to meet many new players and returning players of 1 season level. but, unfortunately, some of them were tired of the continued death and turned off the game itself.

I'm very embarrassed by my awkward sentence because English is not my native language, but i think this is serious problem to New Lights and returning players so i posting it.

Please stop forcibly dragging players to DOE, or new contents.

Edit :  Thank you for your hard work! In our country, this behavior (lowering the light level to join the new lights and helping them) is called a 'The Rescue'. The joining of new rescuers will certainly delight our country's rescuers. Also, the ongoing efforts of young wolves will certainly help new lights settle in D2!</p>

            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">I am sure everyone posts this on a daily, but I feel like if we are all heard, Bungie would do something about the drop rates for adept guns in GMs, when they achieve platinum. I feel like if the rewards are guaranteed in any of the gms, it'll increase the playerbase for the gms, and not only that, but it would feel refreshing knowing that you are going to get a drop from completing the gm, rather than being hopeful that you are getting something, and then get depressed because nothing drops for you at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: hopefully this sounds better than the previous statement, I had made.</p>

Anyone else with horror stories?

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">Beyond light is a good expansion bogged down by some awful design choices that ruin the experience for many.  There's _already_ a lot of unhappy people in the sub right now.  Just wait until the honeymoon period is over and more people start to realize what's wrong.

Bungie, you need to address these things.  _all of them._

We're all worried about the future of the game and want to see it thrive.  But there are so many glaring design flaws that we have to wonder if _you_ know what's best for the game.

- Sunsetting removed 70% of weapons.  We got virtually nothing to replace them.  HMGs are all sunset except for 3.  1 is unobtainable, 1 is from europa, one is from the raid.  The other archetypes aren't fairing much better.  Presumably this will be fixed over time as we get new seasons, but the state it's currently in is unacceptable.  I would have personally been okay with sunsetting if there was a surplus of new and reprised weapons to earn.  But there isn't./

- No refresh to vendors outside of armor.  And the armor itself are all reskins of eachother.

- World drop legendaries are virtually the same as last season.

- The looter shooter currently has so little loot to obtain.

- stasis is super fun in PvE, but is absolutely breaking the game in PvP.  

- Forsaken and Shadowkeep still cost money, but all the gear earned from those expansions outside of the raids is sunset.  You can actually do activities in game right now that drop gear you can't even use in modern PvE activities or trials.  

- Two of the PAID EXPANSIONS are irrelevant now as well so if someone thought they should play each expansion in order and gets forsaken first, they basically wasted $40.

- New light has virtually no content now that all the destinations and raids are vaulted.  

- Your steam discription reads as follows: "Destiny 2 is an action MMO with a single evolving world that you and your friends can join anytime, anywhere, absolutely free."   This is very, VERY misleading and you know it.  There's almost no meaningful free content.  Destiny 2 isn't a free-to-play game, it's a paid game with some free content. 

- No reprised loot from D1 for the return of the cosmodrome??  You bring back the omnigul strike and NOT the grasp of malok??

- On pc, many people are experiencing some SERIOUS performance decreases.  Myself personally I used to get 100+ fps on the EDZ and Tangled Shore at 1440p highest settings.  It goes below 40 now, even if I lower my settings.

- You're now describing Destiny as an MMO, when previously you always avoided that description.  If we are to compare this to other MMOs on the market, Destiny 2 is seriously lacking in content.  

- we know you're all working from home.  But that still doesn't excuse all of this.  You even DELAYED the expansion and I can't for the life of me figure out where the extra time went to.

There's probably a ton more that I haven't listed here.  There is a lot of good to this expansion.  But there's just as many, if not, more bad things about it.

Edit: I am _NOT_ asking for them to stop everything they're doing and fix these issues right away.  I'm simply asking for communication.  We are at a crucial turning point in Destiny and a lot of people are upset over the changes.  We need to hear, now more than ever, that they understand what we're saying and that they will work to fix it.  They have, in the past, ignored user feedback and pretended it didn't exist.  "swept it under the rug" and ignored it until nobody brought it up anymore.  They cannot do this here.  We need to hear from them, and I believe this sub should not stop critiquing their questionable design choices until they do.</p>

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <h3 class="reddit-card__details__text">Hey all, 

&#x200B;

First and foremost, I want to say that these issues aren't being swept under the rug. We're passing up the feedback, and the team has been reading through your thoughts on a variety of topics. Feedback on loot, power caps, etc is definitely heard. 

&#x200B;

Re: Loot feedback- A few things were added to the ritual activities (armor set, ritual weapon, reprises for a few activities) but most of the new content is focused on Beyond Light and Season of the Hunt. Europa has a full armor set and slew of weapons to earn with new perks not available through other means. The raid will have an armor set, various weapons, and mods to earn. Many of you are on the quest for exotics, with more coming in to the fold as you discover them. 

&#x200B;

We definitely understand the comparison to previous releases, and even the amount of weapons that were recently phased out through the max power cap. The team is looking to make the weapons you earn exciting, and they're already looking at loot for future seasons. This isn't to say that your feedback and concerns aren't valid, just noting what rewards are in the game to earn currently.

&#x200B;

For the Free to play experience, we definitely acknowledge that much of the free content just transitioned into the Destiny Content Vault. That said, we sought to replace this with the Cosmodrome returning to the fold, creating the New Light onramp quest to better get players into the game, and creating some quests for subclass unlocks, etc. Once those are completed, players can jump into the ritual content for additional rewards. This doesn't replace the free raid content, but that definitely feedback that we'll get in front of the team.  


Re: Stasis in PvP - Feedback is definitely heard. The team is monitoring community feedback, analytics data, and our own live experiences to address issues as they pop up. Once we have details on future tuning passes, we'll be sure to let you know.  


Re: Issues with PC perf decreases - Highly recommend posting to the help forum on [Bungie.net](https://Bungie.net). The player support team is fielding as many bugs and issues as they can find. Please give some details on your build, helps the team track down the potential issues in compat testing. I've personally hit a few minor framerate issues, but they're occuring once every few hours for a second or two. The more information we get on the help forum, the faster we can get this prioritized and potentially fixed!   


Again - thank you to everyone who's providing feedback. Beyond Light was a huge change to D2 with the introduction of the Destiny Content Vault, loot being rotated out via max infusion caps, and more. The team is looking at the biggest painpoints/issues and prioritizing them as necessary. Some issues may iron out over time as more content is introduced into the game/we get deeper into seasons. Others will take some time to address. In any case, we'll be sure to communicate when we have more info.</h3>

He is absolutely right. I have never seen another studio have quite the same community team. Only Oliver from Fall Guys is in the same league. 


Edit: By popular demand I also going to reference the Warframe and Path of Exile teams who are also in this same league. Community management is important and if so many people are saying they are class acts like our team they deserve praise too.</p>

            <h3 class="reddit-card__details__text">A few thoughts:  


1. We wouldn't be able to execute this job without the game itself. I cannot express enough thanks to the folks on the development team who work through the issues, help get the facts to us for comms drafting, and put so much passion into making a game for YOU, the community.
2. There are numerous teams in this industry that we look to for inspiration. Every community has its own challenges, and every team brings something unique to the table that we can learn from.
3. Our Player Support team is full of amazing folks who provide awesome customer service. They escalate issues to us when needed, and collaborate a TON with the dev team to help prioritize bugs/issues that are meaningful to you.

The long short of it, when you talk about "Destiny Community Management", it's a team effort. Not just the \*community\* team, but the entire team at Bungie. Lucky to be a part of it, and we're always happy to serve.

&#x200B;

On a personal note, DeeJ did a ton of work to build out the community team and set pillars for us to follow. He is a master of hospitality, and came in every day to kick as much ass as he could on behalf of the player. I will forever be grateful to him for helping me land a job on the DPS team a day before House of Wolves started, not to mention his mentorship on my climb to the CM position. Now, we enter a new chapter. Hope to make him, along with you all, proud as we continue to support the Destiny community for years to come.  


Cheers.</h3>

            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">Quite literally the best feeling farm in the game, obviously we had farms that gave us more weapons but this one gave us more things that felt usable. and even though I already sweated out God rolls on my weapons I know there's some guardians out there who don't have God roll beloved's or things like that who would appreciate it, even if it's just for a week

Everybody who's saying " but they'll be useless next season!!!" 
1)there's a month left in this season
2) there's still non light based activities in the game
3) everything in this game doesn't need to hit the light cap to be good or fun
4) shut up
Edit: holy shit guys, my first gold!!! thanks for all the medals!!!</p>

Edit: apparently this is due to the new button mapping but we CANT map it to how we had before.

Edit2: cozmo has acknowledged it. Don’t panic fam they’ll get it done.

            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">u/Cozmo23 Sorry to interrupt you, but you sound like this feedback is something new to you or the team. You are always telling us "we've already been sharing player feedback ..." or "will pass that along to the team", yet **nothing** changed. Nothing.

People want meaningful content and will always prefer such over meaningless public events.

Also, this whole season is just ... empty. The Almighty is not even close to a threat it should've been since the season started. Hell, some people even forgot about it completely. **This is in no way an evolving world.**

**For me, it starts to feel like you guys are collecting feedback over feedback to push this into what, Destiny 3? Another IP?**

#  Just ffs get transparent already. 

STOP the whole PR shit talk and tell us what's really going on. Those last 2 TWABs are just the same shit like we had in Destiny 2 Vanilla, when the former Chief of Whatever approached like a Knight on a white horse to tell us that you are listening. It's 2020 and you are back to the same shit like years ago. What's going on?</p>

            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">Every previous iteration of "Bonus Infamy Week" has been Tues reset through Fri reset = 2x Infamy, Fri reset through Tues reset = 3x Infamy.  Yesterday I noticed I was only getting 2x.  I wanted to be sure it wasn't the same bug with Trials loot resetting at a weird time so I waited until after 5pm PDT today.  Still just 2x.

Huge deal?  Probably not.  Shitty that it changed with no comment from Bungie?  Definitely.  I can't decide if I'm more convinced it's intentional or a bug at this point.

It's currently set up that whichever team gets the kill first wins the match, but it feels really bad to kill someone a frame or 2 after and lose the round. Or even getting off a clutch grenade that kills them from the grave a second or two after feels like you should be rewarded with a round saving tie.

We're looking into it, well share more details when we know more.</h3>

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">How many seasons has it been? I can’t recall, it’s been that many, and still the Iron Banner questlines require you to change your loadout (in a power enabled sandbox, remind you) to use weapons that are awful in this sandbox. For example this season’s quest asks you to use SMGs and bows, which are both in a pretty bad place in terms of PvP. The people running basically anything else just steamroll through entire teams that are trying to eliminate them by shooting peas at them. Throw the stricter-than-necessary SBMM into the mix, and the outcome is nothing short of awful. Four kills with an SMG per match really doesn’t help my own team at all. I’ve rarely had less fun in PvP. Maybe season 4 glory grind tops it, but it’s close.

Also, what is wrong with the matchmaking? I’ve played around a dozen and a half matches of IB since the reset, and every single one of them has been a steamroll. Either your team stomps or you get stomped. For a matchmaking algorithm so strict on skill, it’s doing a pretty abysmal job at it.

Anyway, this is just my two cents. Hope they get their matchmaking and quests sorted out eventually.

**EDIT**

Just to clarify: I absolutely love the game, especially PvP. It’s given me so many great memories, and I’ve met so many people I now call friends. Unlike many people, I didn’t find last season or this one bad. Maybe that’s because I didn’t burn myself out on Vex Offensive, or I just happen to like this type of activity in reasonable portions. I’m not a part of the hate train going on.

I do think that getting people to try out new weapon classes and loadouts is a good idea. Iron Banner with its’ SBMM however might not be the place for it, though. If there is a quest with these steps, it should be for something worth grinding for, like ornaments. It should not be required in order to return tokens. The zone capturing objective is great, and makes players actually contribute to the team effort.

Thanks for the answers, I understand both sides. If you liked the quest, that’s completely fine. This is just my opinion, not the universal truth.</p>

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <h3 class="reddit-card__details__text">Many objectives throughout the quest require you to get zone captures, which is meant to push players towards them. We've seen feedback for quite some time that players don't push the objectives often enough, so I'd love to know if you feel this has helped at all.

We've seen mixed results between feedback around the Iron Banner quest over the last few seasons. While some players leave poor feedback over having to use specific weapon types, others are appreciating a wider range in sandbox when approaching the Iron Banner.

Ex: Rather than seeing every player running the norm, players are using Handcannons, SMG's, Fusion Rifles, and Bows to finish up their quest.

Sure, after you finish the quest you can default to your desired loadout, but the more hardcore among you may be running these quests 3 times. This is also leading to some players who hadn't tried Handcannons or SMG's into new territory, leading to some new playstyles or attempts at strategy.

Throwing this next part in a quote - if you don't care for a quick blurb on my experience in IB, feel free to skip it!
> On my side (as a player), it was nice in the first Iron Banner of the season not seeing Spare Rations/Mindbenders/HardLight immediately. Yes, players will get back to those loadouts after getting through the quest (or they're running them because they don't care about the quest), but it was kind of fun getting through the SMG portion with the Breath of the Dragon that dropped with HighCal. Had no idea that SMG could rip people apart, just needed to approach some encounters in a way other than "jump around the corner and try to hose down the shotgunner".
> 
> I did indeed had a few frustrating moments where my Dire Promise didn't stack up to someone elses, but I eventually got through that step, and just finished the quest up this afternoon. There were indeed a few matches last night where my fireteam (5/6 stack) were stomped with mercy, and most of the time that was poor coordination on our part, not capping zones or winning our 1v1's. I know a few of you don't necessarily care for my opinions on this, but I'm just talking through my experience and looking to better empathize with your feedback.

As a final question for those that have left poor feedback on specific weapons being tied to quest steps - would you rather see more objective/ability requirements, or general "verbs", like headshots, multikills, etc?

Here's a quick list of what I've got from this thread. I know a few are repeats from previous Iron Banners, but we'll be sure to cover them with the team:

* Players do not like being forced to use a specific weapon archetype during IB quest steps

* Players would like to turn in their tokens before finishing the quest

* Players feel that matchmaking restrictions are too strict - Skill seems to be creating a poor environment for 

* some, whether it be load times or general match quality

* SMG's and Bows don't feel appropriate as quest step requirements in the current sandbox

* Continued feedback on Solo vs Fireteam matchmaking

Thanks in advance for the additional feedback.

Am I the only one who doesn’t see the point of collections behind a) being a glorified checklist, and b) for sparrows, emblems, shaders and the like?

Edit: laid down for a nap and my phone exploded, thanks. A couple people brought up a really good point; how would collections work with weapon retirement? That seems like a pretty big question to be asking

Bug # 2: [Infinite Guard:](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/fgqi7x/super_glitch_raijus_harness_gives_infinite/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Yeah, edit, there's also an infinite blocking glitch. Yay.

It also appears that when cancelling the super with the exotic Arcstrider keeps almost all of their remaining super energy, not drop to max of 33% like warlocks. Hoping this is a bug too because that's ridiculously strong.

This could get ugly if Bungie can't patch a fix in asap.

Edit: Bungie has disabled the exotic but the guy in the first video is NOT using it, so it's not addressing the bigger issue of getting all your super energy back on death.

**Edit again: I'm in communication w Bungie's German community manager on twitter, I think they're aware. He's asking if this is still a bug now that the exotic is disabled. I can't test, can anyone do that for us and respond?**

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">Hello. I am JagJon founder of [r/fightinglion](https://www.reddit.com/r/fightinglion/) and I have come with some bad news. The fighting lion has been nerfed in PVP. In the fighting lion discord, we have found that due to the recent changes in the PVP sandbox, The lion's explosive damage has been nerfed, almost halved in some situations. The changes we have seen are reduced explosive damage and reduced blast radius.

With no way to test in the prior patch, we have to rely on our intuition for some aspects of this nerf such as the blast radius. With almost 10,000 crucible fighting lion kills underneath my belt, I can assure you the blast radius has been reduced.

Our fighting lion theorists have three working hypotheses at the moment for this nerf.

1. The PvE buff to direct hits has been applied to PvP.

With a change to direct hits in order to keep balance, the explosive power was dropped. In PVP direct hits with the fighting lion only achieve 98.6% of pre-patch damage values(PrePDM) likewise in PvE we see 98.9% of prePDV. Both are within the margin of error accounting for the difference of damage values in PVP vs PVE (144 vs 10,292). The same holds true for direct hits and overall damage. It seems that the PVE change stated in the patch notes have been applied to PVP.

2. The changes to heavy grenade launchers have changed the Fighting Lion.

With the release of forsaken the fighting lion was in its best state. The forsaken buff to heavy grenade launchers increased the lion's power. Bungie made some back-end changes to how grenade launchers work in these patches. Nothing in the patch has said anything about blast radius for gls, but we can not put it past Bungie to make unannounced nerfs.

3. The lion was meant to be nerfed

True horror, one of the weapons with the highest skill ceiling nerfed by Bungie.

The lion must be returned to glory.  Do you have any ideas about why this change happened? Please comment below.</p>

            <h3 class="reddit-card__details__text">Thanks for the feedback! As with other feedback concerning Firing Range style requests, I'll be sure to note this on the list.

I can say at a glance, this may be a little more complex due to the way Guardians take damage, or other variables you may find in Gambit or the Crucible.

What resilience value? Are they in Super? Do you only wish to see damage numbers, or have a Guardian moving so you can see how difficult it would be to apply damage to a walking/running target? Should Power be enabled to replicate Gambit/Iron Banner, or simply a Guardian taking damage in normal Crucible?

To look at this from a development perspective as well, *what is the problem you're trying to solve?* Do you believe work should be dedicated to this over other sandbox balancing or features? Do you believe a large amount of players would use this feature, or would it primarily be for content creators? Can players snag a friend and do these tests quickly on their own, or just take a weapon into Crucible as damage isn't the only factor when judging newly acquired loot?

Apologies for running through the list. Just love asking questions to get a better understanding of player feedback.</h3>

            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">#[The new Ghost 2.0 interface.](https://i.imgur.com/QMDScae.jpg)

#The Problems

So some problems I wanted to try and fix with this is making ghost shells cosmetic, making seasonal mods easier to start to use, and the over-restriction of loadouts that the champion mods are causing.

#Shells as cosmetics

Currently any shell without Guiding Light is useless. Most of the ghost shells you can buy or unlock are just instant dismantles if they can't roll the right perks. With this, shells would work the same way as projections and would be swapped by left clicking on the ghost slot in the current inventory. 


Right clicking would bring up this interface. Ghost perks would then become mods, dropping and unlocking to be slotted in the center row. The left two slots would be for exotic tier perks, the first right one is for common perks, and the last is for Guiding Light. Guiding Light can then be a perk that unlocks when a ghost is fully upgraded/other unlock conditions. This lets players use whatever shell they want and can expand on the mod system into ghosts.

#Seasonal Mods

Right now using the new seasonal mods are a huge hassle. Using them requires grinding out the new armor which invalidates the previous god rolls and using a exotic means you're missing out on a mod slot. While I get the intention was giving a reason to grind out the new armor but acquiring new pieces with the stats + affinity you want could take a while. Which wouldn't be a problem but with mods that will go away, it feels bad not being able to really effectively use them until the season is well on it's way. 

With this, the seasonal mods will be moved to the outer ring section of the interface with the ghost having it's own energy. The ghost could level with the artifact or with the new activities, with the full energy and slots unlocking along the way. This would give the full five slots regardless of the loadout and get people using the seasonal mods earlier and allow players to spend the rest of the season trying out builds.

#Champion Mods

So one of the biggest complaints right now is how restrictive champion mods make the PvE endgame. It stops being about what is fun but rather what the game forces players to use. Here I also get the intention was to highlight under used weapon types but this makes the endgame less enjoyable.

The proposed idea here is that the bottom most slot will apply the various anti-champion effects across all weapons of an ammo type. So if you wanted your special weapon to be anti-barrier you'd pick the mod in the picture. All the mods would be pre-unlocked. What this achieves is allowing any weapon including exotics to be used in the endgame. But the restriction being you have one effect on one ammo type. This can then be combined with the seasonal weapon specific mods to highlight weapons and let people deal with multiple champion types if they choose. So players aren't forced to use the highlighted weapon types but there is still incentive to.

#Further Features

Not in the image but there would be a slot for shaders, and the kill trackers/stat trackers could be another slot potentially. 

#Thanks for reading!

Edit: Thank you everyone for the kind words and support, it means a lot!</p>

Just to make sure, you are checking the gunsmith with the same character you earned the gear on correct?

Send me a PM with your bungie.net profile and let us know exactly which characters you expect to see the gear on. Also, could you please let us know if you have deleted in characters recently?

            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">So since the new season encourages going to previous planets and getting kills, i figured i'd farm kills while finally obtaining the sleeper nodes for my sleeper.  Well something in the new update must have messed up override frequencies because when i hold to combine it uses 4 and doesnt do anything else.  Went to orbit and recieved nothing, so i tried again with no change (now down 8). Went to the tower and they aren't at the postmaster. Tried one more time, nothing (now down 12).  My consumables aren't full either so this must be a bug cause by the new patch.</p>

            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">Title.

I'm currently 1 triumph away from my first title, and the one thing I need is heroic adventure completions on mercury, and with the way adventures work now, the only way to do heroic adventures is when flashpoint is on the planet.

All the other planets that can have flashpoint have had it at least 2-3 times in these 18 weeks (excluding the moon for obvious reasons). Can we at least have the ability to go to the planet vendor and claim a heroic adventure to do each day? Leaving it entirely to however bungie decide their flashpoints isn't exactly ideal, because for all I know it could be another 18 resets until mercury is flashpoint again.</p>

            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">The community isn't very sympathetic to that argument at the moment. Like, you guys *did* make NF exclusive loot. There is a Scarlet Keep themed sparrow and a Vex themed ghost... but they're both Eververse exclusive. I get that those two teams are probably separate, but that is only an explanation about why it did happen, not a satisfactory justification about why it needed to happen.

People are not going to be happy with the Eververse so long as its *perceived* to be draining content. An easy way to pre-empt this concern is committing to maintain certain features between seasons and make it clear what is getting cut and what those resources are being put towards well before it happens.</p>

            <h3 class="reddit-card__details__text">This is indeed feedback that the team has heard. Before getting into this, I want say clearly, we did not take these rewards from activities and move them to eververse.

To give a bit of context, there were goals to make the entire season/shadowkeep launch feel unified by having items in the Eververse be Vex/Scarlet Keep themed. We have been looking at the feedback and understand how this led to the perception that the rewards were *taken* from activities, rather than created specifically for purchase.

There will always be a drive in development to have Eververse items feel tied to the Destiny universe, but we can be much better at ensuring they don't feel too thematically tied to activities/gameplay rewards.</h3>

Can you PLEASE comment on this issue.  One of my characters (Warlock) had the Black Armor Key Mold in his inventory when Shadowkeep launched.  However, I started playing my Hunter for the new expansion and it is now my main.  I have been trying to complete the Izanagi's questline on my Hunter but I am COMPLETELY STUCK and cannot progress further since the Black Armor Key Mold will NOT be given to me on my alternate characters.  This issue was previously reported in January of this year and was 'supposedly' fixed in Update 2.2.0 in March.  This bug is now returned and the Key Mold is account bound and I cannot progress forward on my Hunter who has a completed Rare bounty and has all 3 keys plugged into the box.

" Fixed an issue where the Black Armory Key Mold quest was account bound, allowing only a single character to acquire it from Ada-1"

[https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47677](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47677)

PLEASE CAN YOU FIX THIS QUESTLINE AND HAVE ADA-1 JUST SELL THE KEY MOLD</p>

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">TL;DR is this working as intended? Is this what bungie planned for pinnacle loot rewards?

Over my 3 characters I have not been able to complete a full set of armor to break the 951 cap. Are we supposed to grind for 3 weeks of rewards and not be able to increase Pinnacle power by even one level point? I'm not against RNG per se, but I feel like I've wasted 3 weeks of effort in an already short season in trying to progress my power gain. 

Raided Garden 3 times each week, 100k Ordeals on all characters, and completed IB rewards on all 3. 

In that time I've leveled my artifact up to +17 and season pass is over 150 which I lost count of. 

Breakdown on 951 drops: 

* Kinetic: 11
* Energy: 15
* Power: 3
* Helmet: 2 warlock - 1 titan
* Gloves: 1 each class
* Chest: 1 warlock - 3 hunter - 2 titan
* Boots: 2 warlock - 1 hunter - 2 titan
* Class: 2 hunter

Edit: since there are some that suggest I could not have looted this many 951 items, I took screenshots from DIM of my vault with filter set to power:951 Also this isn't a complaint about the ability to hit 960 this season (if it's even possible), it's about the level of effort to just get to level 951 based on the amount of time I've invested so far.

    <div class="reddit-card__details">
        
            <h3 class="reddit-card__details__text">A lot of folks throughout this thread are giving great feedback. Record your gameplay, have others give tips, etc.

While LFG can be chaotic, I highly recommend finding some folks to play with. I can already see replies saying "But DMG, you play with streamers, it's not so easy!", "Comp should have a solo queue so I don't have to find a fireteam to go against 4-stacks", or "Your matchmaking should be better."

The feedback is definitely heard for some of the questions posed in the OP, and we'll have more info on the future of Crucible (Quickplay, Competitive) in the coming months. As for Season of Opulence, I'd like to take a moment to word vomit. Pardon the language, but this is just my brain dumping some personal gaming experiences since 2004. Apologies if this isn't the answer you're looking for at the moment, but it's what I've got :) Let me break it down with a few options.

**Find Fireteam Feature: Bungie.net/Destiny Companion App**

> There's the Bungie.net LFG which can be a mix of great fireteams and potential for lifelong friendships, or just groups of folks looking to knock out a couple of wins ASAP. You risk getting some teams that may be harsh, or boot you because they only want a win. It's a more distilled matchmaking, but you can host your own LFG post and clearly state in the title that you're looking to improve. If folks don't play nice with that goal in mind, you have the power to remove them from the fireteam and continue looking for folks who wish to help you.

**General LFG Websites**

> There are also other LFG style websites, like [The100.io](https://www.the100.io/). You can find a group of folks who play around the same time as you, are looking for more casual or hardcore, or whatever other specifics that you may have about your playstyle. There are quite a few portals that other players will suggest to you, and I'd recommend checking out as many as you wish until you find a good home. You may be invited to a new clan, which could help you to have a consistent team to not only improve your skill with, but you improve your communications with. As your team plays together, you all become stronger in filling in weaknesses that you learn from your other team mates. Maybe one player will be a sniper for longer ranges, while you rush in with a fusion/shotgun. One other member could take the mid range fight, or push with you to keep the pressure on. These are all things that build towards more success in competitive environments, as random players don't always communicate, or you don't know exactly what to expect the team to need mid-match.

**Personal experiences with "competitive" online gaming**

> Back in the Halo days, before I had any sort of idea that I'd have a career in gaming or be a community manager at this very studio, I went through the same motions. I had a bit of trouble getting the hang of competitive PvP. MLG settings didn't make sense to me. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. It took quite a bit of practice, many nights of feeling pretty bad about my performance. Hell, I remember shutting off my Xbox a few times because I got tilted from the enemy team taunting me. One of the most important things I learned was to brush off the negativity and keep focus on my personal goals of improvement. Eventually my skill increased and I was able to maintain a 1.0 K/D in my matches. Slow and steady improvement. After so many years, I feel a lot of confidence in general PvP environments. There are definitely matches where I find myself thinking "Wow, I can't do anything right now." - and that's okay. I either take a break to reset, or log off for the night to take a stab at it the next day. Focus on changes to strategy for the best outcomes, and hit it again.
> 
> I am by no means a Crucible pro. I still have a lot to improve on myself. But setting goals and just straight up asking for help is the best start. Just in this last season, I learned a lot about my class set up, armor perks, and some map knowledge. I was able to jam through the Iron Banner quest a lot easier than I first expected, as I asked some folks for tips on weapons or strategies to use. I was able to keep my K/D steady as I went out of my comfort zone, and that felt great. Now I have an Enhanced Unflinching Sniper chest on every class to take into Comp, which could be the make or break between a 1v1.

Making friends in the process is a great feeling, as they build you up along the way. Best of luck to you on your journey. Hope this helps. <3</h3>

            <p class="reddit-card__details__text">What about the Jubilant Engram Duplicate Glitch.  Many people are reporting that they are only getting a fraction of the duplicate engrams they received and in some cases, those are just popping duplicates as well.  Many have speculated that you are only giving the duplicate engrams on the first account that logs in.  And that is relevant to the dupes on that specific account. For example, I got 4 engrams on my hunter on login(they luckily popped no dupes) when account wide I counted 9 duplicates and that is only after I noticed I was getting duplicates.  Still missing a few drops that I would have if the glitch didn't happen.</p>
